1. Main page
    - the button 'czytaj więcej' should be 1/3 vertically closer to buttons 'ebook' and 'druk'
    - yellow box with 'LEAD MAGNET' over the essay must be removed
2. Books page - the whole page is not necessary; I have only three books, including the essay: "Lustra, których nie mamy", "Mirrors We Don't Have" (English translation of Lustra), "Laska i kij". All of them can be displayed on the main page with no need to repeat it in Books. UNLESS this is needed for SEO.
3. books subpages for particular books
    - cover is on a tile, should be as on the first page and smaller
    - when browser window is rescaled to be more narrow, the cover disappears
    - remove the dropdown with readers opinions and the other with read free chapter (question is: is it good from marketing perspective to make free chapters a way of getting email subscribers? not for newsletter but for sending the free chapter but later also for other things?)
    - the list of readers' opinions need to be arrange better visually and in more hand-written font

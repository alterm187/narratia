    "pl": "From Karen Hao's Empire of Al:\n\n\"In their book Power and Progress, MIT economists and Nobel laureates Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson argue that every technology revolution must begin with a rallying ambition. It is the promise of a technology benefiting everyone that puts in motion the long journey of amassing enough talent and resources to turn it into a reality. After analyzing one thousand years of technology history, the authors conclude that technologies are not inevitable. The ability to advance them is driven by a collective belief that they are worth advancing. The irony is that for this very reason, new technologies rarely default to bringing widespread prosperity, the authors continue. Those who successfully rally for a technology's creation are those who have the power and resources to do the rallying. As they turn their ideas into reality, the vision they impose—of what the technology is and whom it can benefit—is thus the vision of a narrow elite, imbued with all their blind spots and self-serving philosophies. Only through cataclysmic shifts in society or powerful organized resistance can a technology transform from enriching the few to lifting the many. The authors point to the invention of a new cotton gin in the 1790s as an example.\"\n\nLater on there is reference to how invention of new cotton gin had worsen conditions of work for slaves in the American South while benefiting the export.\n\nThis belief that the technology \"is worth advancing\" is exactly the drive behind Al development, mainly for connectionists but for symbolists as well. Belief. Like one great social experiment being performed on live tissue.",

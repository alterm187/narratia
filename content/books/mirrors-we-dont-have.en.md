Four people, four different stories marked by loneliness: isolation, rejection, loss, and emptiness. Living near each other, yet unaware of one another's existence, they are adrift in a world that has lost its meaning.

By chance, however, the threads of their lives begin to intertwine, forming a surprisingly coherent pattern. A simple investigation into a technological anomaly evolves into something much greater—a journey into the heart of a mystery that could change them all. They discover that their joint actions have set in motion a process now beyond anyone's control.

"Mirrors We Don't Have" is a moving story about finding oneself in the eyes of another, and about how the deepest cracks within us can be the very places where the light gets in. It is a story about how, to reclaim what was lost, one must sometimes look into a mirror whose existence we never even suspected.

Can a person with limited language skills translate English Romantic poetry? And can AI do it?

This short essay chronicles my journey translating William Wordsworth's 'Ode: Intimations of Immortality'. If you're interested in the topic of creative collaboration between AI and humans, this might intrigue you.

## Essay Excerpt

When I first read William Wordsworth's 'Ode: Intimations of Immortality', I knew I wanted to translate it. There was one problem: my knowledge of English was insufficient for such an ambitious task.

Traditionally, I had two options: either abandon the project or spend years learning the language. But I lived in 2024, in an era when artificial intelligence had become a tool available to everyone.

What initially was meant to be a simple use of AI as a translation tool transformed into something much deeper - into a true dialogue between human intuition and machine precision. Into a process that changed my understanding of both poetry and the nature of human-AI collaboration.

This essay is the story of that journey. About how human creativity and artificial intelligence can together create something neither party could achieve alone. About how the question isn't 'can AI replace humans in creation' but 'how can we collaborate to create better'.

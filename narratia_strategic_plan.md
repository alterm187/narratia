# Narratia - Strategic & Tactical Plan
## Author Platform Development for Sebastian Proba

**Created:** November 2025  
**Planning Horizon:** 12 months  
**Core Philosophy:** Depth over frequency, sustainability over perfection

---

## Executive Summary

This plan recognizes your strengths (deep thinking, quality writing, bridging technology and spirituality) and constraints (introversion, limited social media energy, small current audience). The strategy prioritizes book sales and review acquisition over content marketing vanity metrics, with a sustainable approach that won't burn you out.

**Key Principle:** Your real work is writing books. Everything else supports that or supports book discovery.

## Part 4: Social Media Strategy (Minimal & Sustainable)

### Platform Priority

**Primary: Facebook**
- Your existing presence
- Polish audience
- Good for longer posts
- Keep posting but don't stress frequency

**Secondary: Instagram**
- Visual content (your fragment graphics)
- Cross-post from Facebook
- Use your existing visual assets
- Polish and English hashtags

**Consider (Low priority): LinkedIn**
- Your tech background makes this relevant
- Professional network
- Can share longer-form thoughts
- Good for English-language AI/tech content

**Skip for now: Twitter/X, TikTok, YouTube**
- Too much energy required
- Not your natural format
- Can add later if you want

### Posting Framework (Batch & Reuse)

**Monthly batch creation (1-2 hours):**
1. Create 4-6 posts
2. Mix of types (see below)
3. Schedule across the month
4. Cross-post to all platforms

**Post types (rotate):**

1. **Book excerpts/fragments** (use existing graphics)
   - Your visual posts work well
   - Highlight different quotes
   - Include buy links

2. **Philosophical questions**
   - "Can AI be conscious?"
   - "What makes us uniquely human?"
   - Engage readers in discussion

3. **Behind the scenes**
   - Writing process
   - Research
   - Editing experiences
   - Progress updates

4. **Personal reflection**
   - What you're reading
   - What you're thinking about
   - How it relates to your work

5. **Book announcements**
   - New releases
   - Reviews received
   - Available formats
   - Special offers

6. **Reposts/throwbacks**
   - Your older good posts
   - "One year ago I wrote..."
   - Don't create everything new

### Hashtag Strategy

**Polish hashtags:**
#książki #czytambolubie #bookstagram #polskaksiążka #książka #pisarz #czytam #literatura #polishauthors #czytamksiążki #debiuty #czytampopolsku

**English hashtags:**
#amwriting #writersofinstagram #bookrecommendations #literaryfiction #AIandhumanity #consciousness #scifi #philosophicalfiction #indieauthor #bookstagram

**Specific to your themes:**
#AI #consciousness #spirituality #christianwriter #technophilosophy #synthetic consciousness #artificialintelligence #humanity

### Content Calendar Template (Monthly)

**Week 1:**
- Post 1: Visual book excerpt
- Link to Substack if new post
- Cross-post everywhere

**Week 2:**
- Post 2: Philosophical question or reflection
- Engage with any comments

**Week 3:**
- Post 3: Behind the scenes or personal
- Share something about your process

**Week 4:**
- Post 4: Book announcement or repost old content
- Include call-to-action (buy, review, subscribe)

**Flexibility:** If you miss a week, skip it. If you want to post more, do it. This is a minimum, not a prison.

---

## Part 5: Blog/Website Content Strategy

### Importing Facebook Content

**Priority posts to import:**

1. The "Laska i kij" post about Three Wise Men (Jan 6)
2. AI manuscript correction story (Jan 9)
3. Literary influences post about Kaczmarski (Feb 20)
4. Any posts about your books' themes
5. Philosophical reflections
6. Writing process posts

**How to import:**
- Create blog posts with original Facebook dates
- Add context/expansion if desired
- Tag appropriately
- Link to relevant books
- Include original hashtags as tags
- Add note: "Originally shared on Facebook"

**Benefits:**
- SEO value (Google indexes your content)
- Permanent home for good content
- New visitors can discover your thinking
- Content doesn't disappear if FB changes

### New Blog Content (Low frequency)

**Publish when you have:**
- Book announcements
- New reviews to share
- ARC campaign updates
- Major milestones
- Crosspost from Substack (if appropriate)

**Don't force it:** Your Substack is your main writing space. Blog is supplementary.

---

## Part 11: Dealing with Low Engagement

### Mindset Shifts

**Reality checks:**
1. **Most authors start with tiny audiences.** Your current numbers are normal.
2. **Growth is exponential, not linear.** It feels slow until suddenly it doesn't.
3. **You're building assets.** Every post, every email, every page has compounding value.
4. **Quality readers > quantity.** 10 people who buy and review > 1000 passive followers.
5. **Your introversion is a feature, not a bug.** Depth attracts depth.

### What to Do When Motivation Drops

**Remember:**
- You're not doing this for likes; you're doing this so readers can find your books
- Social media vanity metrics don't equal book sales
- Every piece of content is a "search result" waiting to be found
- Your books are good; discovery takes time
- You're playing a long game

**Practical adjustments:**
- If a platform feels awful, do less there
- If something's working even a little, do more
- If you need a break, take it (but come back)
- Celebrate small wins (every new subscriber, every review)

**The permission slip:**
You don't have to be a "content creator." You're a novelist who occasionally shares thoughts. That's enough.

---

## Part 12: Success Indicators (What to Watch)

### Leading Indicators (Early signs of progress)

- Email list growing steadily (even if slowly)
- People replying to your emails
- Comments on Substack posts
- Reviews trickling in
- Website traffic increasing month over month
- People finding you through search

### Lagging Indicators (Results you're building toward)

- Book sales increasing
- Review count growing
- Being discovered organically (people mentioning you)
- Media opportunities or collaboration requests
- Your next book is easier to launch
- You feel less scattered, more strategic

### What Doesn't Matter (Ignore these)

- Social media follower count
- Post likes and shares (unless translating to action)
- Comparing yourself to authors in different situations
- Trying to go viral
- Doing what everyone else does

---

## Part 13: The Long Game

### Year 1 Goal

**Build the foundation:**
- Solid author platform (website + email + minimal social)
- 500+ engaged email subscribers
- 50+ reviews per book

- Launch next book to existing audience
- Grow email list to 2,000+
- Multiple successful promotion campaigns
- Possible translations or other rights deals
- Established voice in AI/consciousness/spirituality conversation
- Invitations to speak, write, collaborate

### Year 5+ Vision

**Established author career:**
- Multiple books with strong reviews

- You're known in your niche
- Opportunities come to you
- You can focus on writing, not just marketing
- Your introversion and depth are recognized as assets

---

## Part 14: Emergency Protocols

### When You Feel Overwhelmed

**Minimum viable marketing (when life gets crazy):**

1. **Email list only:** Keep sending occasional updates
2. **Substack only:** One essay when you can
3. **Social media:** Let it go dormant if necessary (it's okay)
4. **Website:** Stays up, requires no maintenance
5. **Writing:** Always protect your creative time

**The nuclear option:** Everything can pause except:
- Your email list (email quarterly at minimum)
- Your books staying available for sale
- Your website staying live

### When Something Isn't Working

**Decision framework:**

**After 3 months:** If a strategy shows zero results, adjust or cut it
**After 6 months:** If still not working, probably cut it
**Exception:** SEO and content marketing take 6-12 months to show results

**Questions to ask:**
- Is this taking time away from writing?
- Is this draining my energy?
- Is there any positive indicator at all?
- Am I giving it a fair chance?
- What would I do instead?

---

## Part 15: Quarterly Review Process

### Every 3 Months, Check:

**Metrics review:**
- Email subscriber count (growing?)
- Website traffic (trending up?)
- Book sales (any change?)
- Review count (increasing?)
- Social media (any engagement?)

**Qualitative assessment:**
- What felt good?
- What felt awful?
- What surprised you?
- What do you want to do more of?
- What do you want to stop?

**Strategic adjustments:**
- What's working that you should double down on?
- What's not working that you should cut?
- Any new opportunities?
- Any new constraints?

**Next quarter planning:**
- What are your top 3 priorities?
- What will you say no to?
- What support do you need?

- ✅ Be introverted and still succeed
- ✅ Take breaks when you need them
- ✅ Focus on books over content
- ✅ Say no to opportunities that drain you

- ✅ Prioritize quality over quantity
- ✅ Be yourself, not the author you think you should be

---

## Part 18: Final Notes

### The Core Truth

You're a novelist exploring profound questions about consciousness, humanity, and spirituality in a technological age. That's rare and valuable. The work itself - the books - is what matters most. Everything in this plan exists to help readers discover your books and to build sustainable support for your writing life.

### Measuring What Matters

**Success is not:**
- Viral posts
- Huge follower counts
- Being "everywhere"
- Constant content production

**Success is:**
- Finishing your next book
- Readers finding and loving your current books
- A growing base of supporters who care
- Sustainable systems that don't burn you out
- Making progress, however slow

### The First Step

Don't try to do everything at once. Start here:

1. Set up email capture on your website
2. Create your Substack
3. Write one good essay
4. Batch one month of social posts
5. Then breathe and see what happens

### Remember

You already have the hard part done: you've written books worth reading. Now you're just letting people know they exist. This plan gives you a path, but you can modify it as you learn what works for you.

You've got this.

## Quick Reference: Monthly Checklist

**Every month:**

---

*This plan is a living document. Revisit quarterly, adjust as needed, and always prioritize your actual writing above all else.*

**Questions? Stuck on something? Return to the core principle: What serves your books and your readers? Do that. Cut the rest.**
